============================
ZenPacks.community.LogMatch
============================


Description
===========
This ZenPack monitors logfiles using SNMP capabilities from the netSnmp UCD agent.


Features
========

Device and component object classes
-----------------------------------
* LogMatchDevice with new attributes of:

  - versionTag
  - versionDate

The 1.0.2 version of this ZenPack ignores the LogMatchDevice definition and
modifies the __init__.py to make the LogMatch a component of the os component of
the Device class.  The versionTag and versionDate attributes are added directly to
the Device class attributes.

* LogMatch component with new attributes:

  - logMatchName = ''
  - logMatchFilename = ''
  - logMatchRegEx = ''
  - logMatchCycle = 300
  - logMatchErrorFlag = 0
  - logMatchRegExCompilation = ''


where LogMatchDevice -> contains many LogMatch components


Modeler Plugins
---------------

* LogMatchDeviceMap which gathers:

  - versionTag
  - versionDate

* LogMatchMap which populates:

  - logMatchName
  - logMatchFilename
  - logMatchRegEx
  - logMatchCycle
  - logMatchErrorFlag
  - logMatchRegExCompilation

The 1.0.2 version of the ZenPack chnges the LogMatchMap modeler to ensure the LogMatch
components are added to a Device's os component.


Monitoring Templates
--------------------

* Component templates

  - LogMatch with an SNMP datasource to gather logMatchCurrentCounter (1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.16.2.1.7) with a GAUGE datapoint


MIBs
----
* UCD-SNMP-MIB


GUI modifications
-----------------

* The Overview display for a device of object class LogMatchDevice has the SNMP panel
  modified to remove the SNMP community name and to add versionTag and versionDate.

Usage
=====

It is suggested that a new Zenoss Device Class be created to hold devices of object class LogMatchDevice.
Set the zPythonPath zProperty of the new class to be ZenPacks.community.LogMatch.LogMatchDevice.

The community.snmp.LogMatchDeviceMap and community.snmp.LogMatchMap modeler plugins should also be
assigned to this Zenoss Device Class.

The 1.0.2 version of the ZenPack will need the modeler plugins assigning either to a relevant
class or to specifi device instances.


The SNMP agent on monitored devices must support net-SNMP with the UCD MIB.
To configure an agent, add the following line to snmpd.conf (usually in /etc/snmp). You
will need root privilege::
  logmatch fred1_daily /opt/zenoss/local/fredtest/fred1.log_%Y%m%d 300 test

This will monitor a file under /opt/zenoss/local/fredtest whose name is fred1.log_20160504
every 5 minutes, looking for lines containing test, where the last part of the filename is
the date in yyyymmdd format.  The snmpd daemon must be restarted before the change will be activated, with::
  service snmpd restart
  /etc/init.d/snmpd restart


To test using snmpwalk for a device zenny1.class.example.org, using SNMP V2 with a community
of public, try::
  snmpwalk -v 2c -c public zenny1.class.example.org 1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.16

After at least 5 minutes, a graph should be produced for each entry with the count of lines
in the specified file containing the specified search string.

   - Modified Overview display for LogMatchDevice devices to remove SNMP community and to add 
     versionTag and versionDate to the SNMP panel.
* 1.0.2
   - The 1.0.2 version of this ZenPack ignores the LogMatchDevice definition and
     modifies the __init__.py to make the LogMatch a component of the os component of

     the Device class attributes. The version is held in the device branch on github.
